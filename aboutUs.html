        <hr>
        <p>Ms. Abigail and Mr. Matthew are both 20 years old, first-year college students, and a 5-year couple. Mr. Matthew is under the course of Computer Engineering while Ms. Abigail is studying BS Information Technology. 
        She founded The Rail in 2024 as a symbol of her love for him, who is interested in skateboarding. As a show of collaboration, she encouraged Mr. Matthew to become her co-owner as well. 
        The relationship they share provides balance to the business because Ms. Abigail has operational skills and knowledge, whereas Mr. Matthew is good at learning the necessary parts and supplies. Because they are both just starting their own company, they chose to work together with a variety of local and worldwide businesses. 
		Hoping that their goal in 5 years, they will be producing their own product.</p>
